nozzle_xy_position: -5.5, 163.5 # 
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the Z endstop.
switch_xy_position: -3.0, 143.5 # 
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on the Z endstop.
bed_xy_position: 164, 164
# default from relative_reference_index of bed_mesh
#   a X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the relative
#   reference index at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
switch_offset: 0.43 # bylo 0.45 podnosze - 0.5 katalogowo bardzo ciasno  - jesli damy mniej to dzysza bedzie wyzej 
max_deviation: 1.0
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset. If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop! default is 1.0 mm.
samples: 3
clearance: 5 
# 2 * z_offset from the "probe:z_offset" section
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
speed: 250  #   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
#lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's configuration.
probing_speed: 6
# default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: 2
# default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: 1.5
# default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.
#   Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: false

#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to

before_switch_gcode: ATTACH_PROBE
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: DOCK_PROBE #M402
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
